# eZobj2mol
a slightly less bad .glb to decompressed .mol converter for lbp1!
currentlly uses yellowhead as a base, although this can easily be changed by copying the last part of the .mol to the template


it currentlly supports vertex normals, vertices, UVs and faces





some of this code is not by me, spefically the vertex normals code which is by ennuo

also thanks ennuo for helping out
