# eZobj2mol
a VERY BAD .obj to decompressed .mol converter for lbp1!
it works by replacing data in the pod.mol so theres a limit of 11k vertices and 4k faces
it currentlly supports vertex normals, vertices, UVs and faces
this is basiaclly a pod.mol file so whatever that mol can be used in, the converted mol can be used in
also that would mean you would have to get a lbp1 pod.mol to compress it as its decompressed


THIS IS VERY BAD, IF I WAS YOU I WOULD JUST WAIT UNTILL WORKBENCH IS PUBLIC

some of this code is not by me, spefically the vertex normals code which is by ennuo
